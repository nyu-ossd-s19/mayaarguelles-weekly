> Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.

I think this quote means that often, the most helpful way of solving a problem is reframing the problem itself. This definitely seems to be a true -- if you're coming at a problem from the wrong angle it's going to be difficult or impossible to come up with a good solution. Even if you are looking at the 'right' angle, perhaps a different perspective could provide greater insight or produce 'striking and innovative' solutions.

> Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.

I think this lesson goes hand in hand with the other lesson -- it reframes the problem of design as a reductive process rather than an additive one. I am minoring in digital art and design and I've heard this truism repeated many times and often (but not always, in my opinion) this does ring true. A lot of times the first impulse when designing or creating anything is to add more bells and whistles, which can result in an overwhelming product. Instead, often the more important process is once everything is added, deciding what needs to be pared back until everything makes sense and is necessary.

> Talk about one of the lessons from The Cathedral and the Bazaar essay that you liked the most and that resonated with you the most.

"To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you."

This lesson seemed kind of stupid at first, because it's essentially just saying "to solve an interesting problem, find an interesting problem", but it really succinctly summarizes the notion that passion is of utmost importance in any field. If a problem is not interesting to you, it won't be rewarding solving that problem in any sense of the word 'rewarding' -- you'll have no personal investment in the problem or its outcome.

## Project Progress

This week I was still working on the secondary solution to the git submodule bug, and was mostly falling down a rabbithole of documentation from various node modules. I'm going to try just reaching out to the community for help with the suggested implementation this week.
